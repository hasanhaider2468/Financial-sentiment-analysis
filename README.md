# Financial-sentiment-analysis

Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for investors and businesses alike as it provides valuable insights into market trends and investor attitudes. By analyzing sentiments expressed in financial news, social media, and other sources, stakeholders can gauge the overall sentiment towards specific assets or markets. This information helps in making informed decisions regarding investment strategies, risk management, and market timing. Additionally, sentiment analysis enables the identification of emerging trends and sentiments that may impact financial markets, providing a competitive edge in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.

In this project, I seek to evaluate the sentiment analysis of several different texts regarding finance. I will be evaluating the impact of certain key terms of the overall polarity of sentences. Ideally figuring out what significant words in financial texts would intensify the polarity to be negative or positive.
